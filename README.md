# SQL-Challenge-
Data Bootcamp Week 9 HW on SQL
In this homework challenge, we're data engineers at a fictious company Pewlett Hackard. The objective of this challenge- 
is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. 

We were given six csv files containing employee data and given questions to answer via queries.  

I created tables in pgAdmin 4 using the csv files and a postgres file generated from Quickdatabasediagrams.com. Again, I used Xpert Learning, and reached out to my instructor and classmates for help on error messages I kept getting regarding the data types.  I realized there were columns in the csv that aren't in the created table.  

I relied heavily on Xpert Learning for the queries themselves.
